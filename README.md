# PWA Text Editor

## Description

This project was created as tool to help with taking notes and to explore the process behind creating a Progressive Web App. As a junior Web Developer I wanted to become familiar with new systems and types of web applications. Through the creation of this app I gained valuable knowledge on webpack configuarations and the process behind Progressive Web Apps.

## Installation

- Copy the files from this git repo and run in whichever software you use
- Then in the cli type "npm install"
- "npm run start"
- "npm run start:dev"
- Then navigate to your localhost:3000/?index
- In the upper left hand corner you should see the install button, click it and you will be prompted with a download
- In the event that doesn't appear click the monitor icon in the address bar and you should be able to download it from there

## Usage

To use the Text Editor simply type into the program as if you were using notepad, except in the case of this app you will see that javascript elements and code snippets will appear as they do in VSCode
